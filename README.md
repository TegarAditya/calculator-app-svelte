# Simple Calculator App Made With Svelte 5

This project has an initial aim to fulfill the BNSP competency certification (programmer occupation). Feel free to use this project to practice object-oriented programming (OOP) using JavaScript and reactivity in Svelte 5.

## Project Preparation

Let's prepare our workspace(s)!

```bash
# clone this repository
git pull https://github.com/TegarAditya/calculator-app-svelte.git

# navigate to project directory
cd calculator-app-svelte
```

## Running Development Environment

Once you've cloned and moved to the project's repository folder, you'll start running a few steps including package installation and running dev commands.

```bash
# install package
pnpm install

# start the dev server
pnpm dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
